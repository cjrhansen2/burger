# burger - BootCamp HW 13

## Description
This is an application that lets me practice using Heroku, mysql, JawsDB, and handlebars. You can add diferent burgers, devour them, and it all interacts with a mysql database where the burgers are stored.

## Installation
Go to the link where the app is running live, hosted by Heroku. Can be found here: https://thawing-cove-84833.herokuapp.com/


## Usage

App is intended to have two columns: a list of burgers yet to be devoured, and a list of burgers that have been devoured. The two columns are drawn from a SQL database of burgers. Users can add burgers to this database and remove them by devouring.
